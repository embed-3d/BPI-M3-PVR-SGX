# BPI-M3-PVR-SGX
### Bananapi M3 BSP with PVR SGX Driver
This Project is based on the [Sinovoip BPI-M3-bsp](https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M3-bsp.git). Since the Sinvoip repo is most of the time broken, I buildt up a repo where everything should work. The intention of this Repo is to build a reliable reverse engineering platform for the PVR-SGX driver.
## Setup
### ubuntu 14.04 LTS
required packages:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi u-boot-tools device-tree-compiler
```

## Configure kernel
```
make kernel-menuconfig
```

## Build kernel
```
make kernel
```
## Transfer Kernel & Modules to SD-Card
### Requirements for the Script
The BOOT partition should be mounted in this direcectory : `/media/${CURRENT_USER}/BPI-BOOT/` and the ROOT Partition should be mounted here: `/media/${CURRENT_USER}/BPI-BOOT/`
### Run Script
```
cd scripts
./transfer_sd_card.sh
```
## Kown Issues
- Hardfloat issue: This processor should be normaly built with gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf- 
- Needs ubuntu 14.04LTS
- if you change the config somehow, kernel breaks.

## Todo:
- [ ] Write function similar to PDUMPMEM

## Enable infos for Reverese engineering
1. `make kernel-menuconfig`
2. Go to Device Drivers --> Graphics Support --> [*] IMGTEC PowerVR SGX GPU Support --> [*] Add a special printk for Driver Reverse engineering
3. Quit menuconfig and save config
4. Build Kernel
5. Replace uImage, uEnv.txt, script.bin and sys_config.fex on the boot partition 
6. Replace the Modules
7. Boot your device
8. run dmesg or capture bootlog
